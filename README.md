# Sea star swab DNA extraction method comparison 
How well do commercially available DNA extraction kits perform for dermal swab samples from sea stars?

Here we provide the scripts and data files to reproduce analyses for a project comparing commercially available DNA extraction kits for the use of DNA extractions from dermal swabs collected from sea stars. The results of this comparison are detailed in the submitted manuscript entitled: Comparison of DNA extraction methods for examining asteroid dermal microbiomes in the context of sea star wasting disease.

Bioinformatic process of these data largely employed QIIME2 and are detailed in the file `seastar_extest_qiime2scripts.txt`.

Data visualization and statistical tests were performed in R. The bulk of the analyses are available in `Sea Star 16S Analysis and Visualizations.Rmd`.
